Extra Credit Explanation 

Window 1: Graphics

I created a Map of the North American Continent using the shapes available in JavaFX of different colors, shapes, sizes, and orientations.
My map is based off of a Russian art form: Suprematism
Suprematism is an early twentieth-century art movement focused on the fundamentals of geometry, painted in a limited range of colors. 
The term suprematism refers to an abstract art based upon "the supremacy of pure artistic feeling" rather than on visual depiction of objects. 

Hopefully my art piece can invoke this feeling!

Window 2: CS Food Truck 

I added a few of my own features to the program. 

Feature 1 - Improved Receipt
Pressing purchase will create a text file called order.txt and store the contents of the receipt there.
The receipt contains each item, its quantity, its individual price, and the total price for that particular object along with the final cost at the end. 

It also prints it out onto the console. 

Feature 2 - Information about the Food
I created an extra button for each food item. Upon being pressed it opens a window with a picture of the food and the ingredients present in it. 

Feature 3 - Aesthetics
I tried to make the UI aestheticallyh pleasing using colors, even spacing, and dimensions.
